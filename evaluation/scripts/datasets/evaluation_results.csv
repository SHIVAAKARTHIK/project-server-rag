What is autoimmune disorders an type of autoimmune disorders?,"['1.3 Organ-specific and systemic autoimmune disorders\n\nAutoimmune disorders can be broadly categorized into two main types based on their scope and the areas of the body they affect: organ-specific autoimmune disorders and sys- temic autoimmune disorders (Ramos-Casals et al., 2021). Here is a distinction between the two.\n\n1.3.1 Organ-specific autoimmune disorders\n\nOrgan-specific autoimmune disorders primarily target and affect a specific organ or tissue in the body. The immune response is localized to a particular site. Examples includes\n\n* Type 1 Diabetes: The immune system attacks the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, affecting blood sugar regulation.\n\n* Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis: The immune system targets the thyroid gland, leading to hypothyroidism.\n\n* Celiac Disease: The immune system reacts to gluten, primarily affecting the lining of the small intestine.\n\nSymptomis in organ-specific autoimmune disorders are typically related to the specific organ or tissue under attack. For instance, in Type 1 Diabetes, symptoms include increased thirst, frequent urination, and high blood sugar levels. Similarly, diagnosis often involves tests specific to the affected organ or tissue. Treatment may focus on managing symptoms, replacing missing hormones, or controlling the immune response in that particular area.', '1. Introduction to autoimmune disorders\n\nAutoimmune disorders, commonly referred to as autoimmune illnesses, are a class of dis- eases in which the immune system of the body unintentionally targets its own healthy cells and tissues. The immune system’s primary function is to defend the body against harmful diseases including bacteria, viruses, and other intruders. In autoimmune illnesses, however, the immune system degenerates and starts to attack healthy cells and tissues as though they were outside intruders. Numerous symptoms and health issues might result from this.\n\nWhite blood cells, antibodies, and other immune system elements cooperate to recognize and eliminate dangerous chemicals in a healthy immune system. Self- recognition is impaired in autoimmune illnesses, and the immune system is unable to distinguish between “self” and “non-self.” Over 80 autoimmune diseases are recognized, and they can affect almost any organ in the body. Rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, and celiac illness are a few typical instances (Wang et al., 2015). Although the precise origin of autoimmune illnesses is not entirely understood, it is thought that a complex interaction of hereditary and environmental variables is to blame. These disorders may be genetically predisposed in some people, and environmental fac- tors like infections or exposure to specific chemicals may also contribute to the immune response.\n\nThe specific illness and the organs or tissues that are impacted can have a significant impact on the symptoms of autoimmune disorders. Fatigue, joint discomfort, muscular weakness, skin rashes, and digestive issues are a few typical symptoms. Over time, symp- tom severity can also change. Because autoimmune disorders’ symptoms might resemble those of other diseases, diagnosing them can be difficult. To make a diagnosis, doctors frequently combine medical histories, physical examinations, blood testing, and imaging studies. A biopsy of the afflicted tissue may be required in some circumstances (Bieber et al., 2023). Although there is no known treatment for autoimmune illnesses, many can be controlled. Typically, the purpose of treatment is to decrease inflammation and\n\nRole of Medicinal Plants in Autoimmune Diseases ISBN 978-0-443-18776-6 https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-443-18776-6.00003-7\n\n© 2025 Elsevier Inc.

The immune response is not confined to a single organ or tissue but is distributed system- ically. Examples includes\n\n* Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE): SLE can affect the skin, joints, kidneys, heart, lungs, and other organs.\n\n* Rheumatoid Arthritis: Although it primarily affects the joints, it can also have sys- temic effects on the heart, lungs, and other organs.\n\n* Sjégren’s Syndrome: These affects the salivary and tear glands, but it can also involve other parts of the body, including joints and nerves.\n\n42 Role of Medicinal Plants in Autoirmmune Diseases\n\nSymptomis associated with systemic autoimmune disorders are diverse and can involve a wide range of organs and tissues. Common systemic symptoms may include fatigue, joint pain, skin rashes, and fever. Diagnosis often relies on a combination of symptoms, blood tests, and medical history. Treatment aims to manage the overall immune response and alleviate symptoms affecting various parts of the body. Medications that modulate the immune system are commonly used. This chapter aims to provide a scholarly and in- depth exploration of organ-specific autoimmune disorders, delving into the intricate mechanisms, diagnostic methodologies, and therapeutic strategies employed in managing these conditions. By focusing on the autoimmune afflictions that selectively target partic- ular organs—such as the skin (e.g., psoriasis), thyroid (e.g., Hashimoto’s thyroiditis), pancreas (e.g., type 1 diabetes), and joints (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis)\\—we will uncover the nuances of these disorders at a molecular and clinical level. Whether one’s interest is driven by a clinical perspective, a scientific inquiry, or the personal experience of living with or caring for individuals afflicted by these disorders, this exploration strives to pro- vide a comprehensive understanding of the complexities inherent in organ-specific auto- immune diseases.', '39\n\n40 Role of Medicinal Plants in Autoirmmune Diseases\n\nto inhibit the aberrant immune response. Corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and disease-modifying antirheumatic medicines (DMARDs) are often prescribed medica- tions. Additionally, lifestyle adjustments like stress management and nutritional changes could be advised.\n\n1.1 What are autoimmune disorders?\n\nThe term “autoimmune disorder” refers to a group of diseases where the body’s immune system, which is meant to protect against pathogens like bacteria and viruses, mistakenly targets and attacks its own healthy cells, tissues, and organs. Autoimmune disorders are a subset of these diseases. In essence, the immune system becomes unable to differentiate be- tween “self” and “non-self,” which causes tissue damage, inflammation, and a variety of symptoms and health issues that are unique to the affected organs or systems. There are approximately 80 identified autoimmune illnesses, each with a distinct set of symptoms and effects that can affect almost any organ of the body (Mackay et al., 2001). These con- ditions can be chronic and require ongoing management, as there is typically no cure, but various treatments are available to help control symptoms and reduce the autoimmune response.', '3. Endocrine organ-specific autoimmune disorders\n\nThe human endocrine system, consisting of a complex network of glands and organs, plays a pivotal role in maintaining homeostasis within the body. These endocrine organs secrete hormones, which act as messengers, regulating a myriad of physiological pro- cesses, from metabolism to growth and development, and even the immune response. This intricate system is finely tuned to ensure that hormones are released in the right amounts at precisely the right time. However, this harmony can be disrupted when the immune system malfunctions, leading endocrine organ-specific autoimmune disor- ders. Endocrine organ-specific autoimmune disorders are characterized by the immune system’s attack on a particular endocrine organ or gland, disrupting its normal function and causing a range of clinical symptoms.\n\nWe will explore how autoimmune responses can affect organs such as the thyroid, pancreas, and adrenal glands. Understanding the underlying mechanisms and complex- ities of these disorders is crucial not only for healthcare professionals but also for patients who grapple with the profound impact these conditions have on their daily lives. This section will focus on several well-documented endocrine organ-specific autoimmune disorders, including type 1 diabetes mellitus (McLeod & Cooper, 2012), Hashimoto’s\n\nOrgan-specific autoimmune disorders 45\n\nthyroiditis (Pociot & Lermmark, 2016), and Addison’s disease (Michels & Eisenbarth, 2009). These conditions represent a diverse spectrum of endocrine disorders, each with its unique etiology, clinical presentation, and therapeutic approach.']","Autoimmune disorders are a group of diseases where the body's immune system, which is normally responsible for protecting against pathogens like bacteria and viruses, mistakenly targets and attacks its own healthy cells, tissues, and organs. This misdirected immune response leads to inflammation, tissue damage, and various symptoms depending on the organs or systems affected. There are approximately 80 identified autoimmune diseases, each with its own unique set of symptoms and effects that can impact almost any organ of the body.

Autoimmune disorders can be broadly categorized into two main types:

1. **Organ-specific autoimmune disorders**: These disorders primarily target and affect a specific organ or tissue. The immune response is localized to a particular site. Examples include:
   - **Type 1 Diabetes**: The immune system attacks the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.
   - **Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis**: The immune system targets the thyroid gland, leading to hypothyroidism.
   - **Celiac Disease**: The immune system reacts to gluten, affecting the lining of the small intestine.

2. **Systemic autoimmune disorders**: These disorders affect multiple organs and systems throughout the body. The immune response is distributed systemically, not confined to a single organ or tissue. Examples include:
   - **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**: Can affect the skin, joints, kidneys, heart, lungs, and other organs.
   - **Rheumatoid Arthritis**: Primarily affects the joints but can also have systemic effects on the heart, lungs, and other organs.
   - **Sjögren’s Syndrome**: Affects the salivary and tear glands, but can also involve other parts of the body, including joints and nerves.

These disorders require ongoing management as they can be chronic, and while there is typically no cure, various treatments are available to help control symptoms and reduce the autoimmune response.",1.0,0.6878573135182295
How Genetics invoved in autoimmune disorders?,"['10.1 Unraveling complex genetic and environmental interactions\n\nAutoimmune diseases develop when a genetically predisposed individual is exposed to an environmental trigger that may be responsible for developing autoimmunity (Doria et al., 2010; laccarino et al., 2011; Zen et al., 2011). Autoimmune diseases are a prime example of multigenic diseases. Numerous genetic relationships with autoimmune diseases have been discovered through the use of candidate gene techniques in conjunction with genome-wide association studies (Dai et al., 2010). Infectious agents, ultraviolet light, chemicals or other substances that can modify immune responses, such as environmental pollutants or drugs and behavioral factors, such as smoking and diet are examples of envi- ronmental exposures that could be involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases (Borchers et al., 2010; Ranque & Mouthon, 2010; Selmi, 2011; Selmi & Tsuneyama, 2010; Tobon et al., 2010). The development of autoreactive T cells and autoantibodies, the induction of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and injury to the target end organ are all possible outcomes of additional environmental exposures (Choe et al., 2011; Cutolo et al., 2011). Epigenetics is a novel concept in the field of autoimmunity (Lu et al., 2010). The term “epigenetics” describes changes in gene expression that do not entail modifications to the DNA sequence. It is interesting to note that since epigenetic systems are responsive to outside stimuli, changes in epigenetic regulation can act as a mediator for environmental impacts on immune responses. DNA methylation and\n\nOrgan-specific autoimmune disorders 65', '2.3 Genetic and environmental factors contributing to susceptibility\n\nPredisposing factors for autoimmune diseases include genetic background, hormonal status, pathogens, and xenobiotic exposures (Wang et al., 2015). The current model of autoimmune disease suggests that disease develops in a genetically susceptible individ- ual in response to an environmental trigger (Pisetsky, 2023). Multiple genes with spe- cific gene mutations (i.e., AIRE, TNFRSF6, FOXP3 and CD25), HLA susceptible, non-HLA loci (i.e., PRPN22, IRF5-TNFO3 and BACH2) as well as epigenetic mech- anisms (methylation, acetylation, ubiquination, sumoylation, phosphorylation and microRNA) have been implicated in specific autoimmune diseases (Wang et al., 2015). Most autoimmune diseases are multigenic; nevertheless single-gene mutations can powerfully influence disease susceptibility. Heterozygous mutations in AIRE cause organ-specific autoimmune disease (Oftedal et al., 2015). Many autoimmune diseases occur with a higher frequency in women than men, with sex representing a major ge- netic risk factor.\n\nMultiple environmental factors including microorganisms, xenobiotics (drugs, smok- ing, UV lights, heavy metals), host microbiota and nutrition have been implicated in the development of autoimmunity. “Molecular mimicry” is the most common mechanism that activates autoreactive T and B cells. “Epitope spreading” is a mechanism that results in generation of multiple neo-epitopes. In addition, by modulating innate and adaptive immunity, the microbiota and nutrition (e.g., vitamin D, iodine and gluten) may also contribute to loss of tolerance (Wang et al., 2015).', 'histone modification are the two main methods of epigenetic gene regulation. These two processes cooperate to modify the chromatin structure, which in turn either promotes or inhibits gene transcription. Micro RNAs are one of the recent epigenetic mechanisms to be discovered (Gu et al., 2010; Ooi et al., 2010; Song et al., 2011). The pathophysiology of these disorders is ultimately influenced by the immunological changes that silicon exposure can bring about, such activation of cellular recruitment, cytokine production, Th1-Treg misbalance or reactive oxygen species release (Speck-Hernandez & Montoya- Ortiz, 2012). Immune competence and dietary components, such as vitamins, minerals, and trace elements, have a well-established relationship (Selmi & Tsuneyama, 2010). This implies that certain nutrients may be linked to an increased risk of autoimmune disorders. Recent research has demonstrated how genetic-epigenetic interactions between dietary micronutrients that influence DNA methylation can either worsen or reduce murine lupus (Strickland et al., 2013). Additionally, dietary changes can affect the gut flora, which has been linked to autoimmune diseases (Brown et al., 2012). A high-sodium diet has recently been found to encourage the growth of Th17 helper T cells, which act as mediators of autoimmune inflammation (Chuan Wu et al., 2013). The induction of murine and human Th17 cells, which are responsible for autoimmune diseases, was dramatically enhanced by elevated NaCl concentrations at physiological levels (Kleine- wietfeld et al., 2013).\n\nThe field of epigenetics focuses on the chemical alteration of DNA, such as DNA methylation, which has the potential to change gene transcription and subsequently cell function. There is strong evidence that environmental exposures have an effect on epigenetic markers since they are flexible and may change over the course of a person’s life (Foley et al., 2009). Smoking, for instance, has been demonstrated to modify DNA methylation at several genomic loci (Breitling et al., 2011; Wan et al., 2012) and there is evidence that numerous other pollutants and chemicals can also alter the epigenome (Feil & Fraga, 2012). Epigenetics thus offers a biological basis for the interaction of environ- ment and genes in autoimmune illnesses and other diseases (Javierre et al., 2011). Epige- netics also offers a conduit via which the environment can influence genes. The third hypervariable region of the HLA DR1 chain, encoded by the DRB1 gene, is where the rheumatoid arthritis “shared epitope” (SE) specifies a group of HLA types that have a common amino acid sequence (Gregersen et al., 1987). As a result of the strong gene-environment interactions between smoking and the presence of the strongest ge- netic risk factors for RA, HLA-DRB1 shared epitope (HLA SE) and PTPN22, smoking significantly raises the risk of developing RA in people who carry the susceptibility genes (Costenbader et al., 2008; Karlson et al., 2010).', '10.3 Role of microbiota in autoimmune disorders\n\nPersons who have autoimmune illnesses experience an imbalance between their immune system’s tolerogenic and immunogenic functions. Autoreactive B and T cells that evade central tolerance and respond to self-antigens attacking healthy bodily tissues frequently play a role in pathogenesis (Brzezicka & Paulson, 2023). Multiple interactions may be predisposed to cause autoimmune disorders. In actuality, an environmental trigger causes an autoimmune illness to manifest. As was already established, heredity plays a significant role in the development of autoimmune illness and accounts for roughly half of the risk of developing the condition; the remaining half is brought on by environmental factors. Microbial elements, particularly those that lead to a persistent infection, food, metal, toxins, radiation, and sex hormones like estrogen are some of the most hazardous causes. Additionally, immune system alterations might be brought on by nutritional deficits (Carson, 1992; Selmi & Tsuneyama, 2010). For instance, the innate immune system’s NLRP6 and nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NBOD2) activities, which are both crucial for bacterial recognition, allow the micro- biota to play a significant role (Levy et al., 2015; Petnicki-Ocwieja et al., 2009). Dysbiosis or immune system dysfunction can disrupt the maintenance of homeostasis between the microbiota and the immune system, which can result in an uncontrolled inflammatory condition or breakdown of tolerance and the onset or promotion of autoimmunity (Shamiriz et al., 2016).\n\nIfthe mechanisms of tolerance fail, the microbes can cause the immune response to be directed against the host in various different ways (Agmon-Levin et al., 2009; Getts et al., 2013; Guilherme et al., 2006; Vanderlugt & Miller, 1996; Vojdani, 2014). Rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and antiphospholipid syndrome are just a few of the autoimmune diseases that have been associated with autoantibodies against the ubiq- uitous commensal yeast Saccharomyce cerevisiae’s cell wall mannan (phosphopeptido- mannan), or mannan. Due to the fact that S. cerevisiae is also a vaccine adjuvant, researchers have speculated about a potential risk of aberrant immune activation that could be related to an autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA) (Ranaldi et al., 2013; Shoenfeld & Agmon-Levin, 2011). Inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), provide as an illustration of how changes to the gut microbiome can lead to disease. Notably, multiple', '1.

Here are the key points that detail how genetics are involved:

1. **Genetic Predisposition and Multigenic Nature**: Autoimmune diseases are often multigenic, meaning they are influenced by multiple genes rather than a single gene mutation. However, single-gene mutations can also significantly impact disease susceptibility (Document Chunk 2).

2. **Specific Gene Mutations and Loci**: Several specific genes and loci have been implicated in autoimmune diseases. These include:
   - **AIRE, TNFRSF6, FOXP3, and CD25**: Mutations in these genes are directly linked to autoimmune diseases.
   - **HLA Susceptible and Non-HLA Loci**: Such as PRPN22, IRF5-TNFO3, and BACH2, which are associated with autoimmune conditions (Document Chunk 2).

3. **Epigenetic Mechanisms**: Epigenetics, which involves changes in gene expression that do not alter the DNA sequence, also plays a crucial role. Epigenetic mechanisms include DNA methylation, histone modification, and the action of microRNAs. These mechanisms can be influenced by environmental factors and can mediate the effects of these factors on gene expression, impacting the immune response and potentially contributing to autoimmune diseases (Document Chunk 1 and 3).

4. **Sex as a Genetic Risk Factor**: Many autoimmune diseases occur more frequently in women than in men, indicating that sex chromosomes and possibly hormones influenced by genetic factors contribute to disease susceptibility (Document Chunk 2).

5. **Gene-Environment Interactions**: The interaction between genetic predispositions and environmental triggers is crucial in the development of autoimmune diseases. For example, the presence of certain genetic markers like the HLA-DRB1 shared epitope can increase the risk of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, especially when combined with environmental factors like smoking (Document Chunk 3).

These points collectively illustrate that genetics contribute to autoimmune disorders through a complex interplay of multiple genes, epigenetic modifications, and interactions with environmental factors. This genetic basis helps explain why certain individuals are more susceptible to developing autoimmune diseases than others.",1.0,0.8466186945613545
